I am a research assistant at the [NBER](https://www.nber.org/), working with [Sam Bazzi](https://sites.google.com/site/samuelbazzi/).

I received my MA in Economics and BA in Economics and Mathematics from Boston University. I hope to start my Ph.D. in Economics in the Fall of 2025.

My research interests are in political economy and development.
