I am a research assistant at the [NBER](https://www.nber.org/), working with [Samuel Bazzi](https://sites.google.com/site/samuelbazzi/).

I received my M.A. in economics and B.A. in economics and mathematics from Boston University. I hope to start my Ph.D. in economics in the Fall of 2025.

My research interests are in political economy and development.
