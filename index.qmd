I am a research assistant at UCSD's [School of Global Policy and Strategy](https://gps.ucsd.edu/).

I was previously a research assistant at the NBER. I received my M.A. in economics and B.A. in economics and mathematics from Boston University.

I am interested in political economy, development, and economic history.

You can email me at [fessa\@ucsd.edu](mailto:fessa@ucsd.edu).
